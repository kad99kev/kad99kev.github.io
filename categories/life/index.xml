      <description>On the 6th of September 2022, I completed a year in Ireland. A year that feels almost a moment ago. Many memories made, and most certainly happy ones. I consider myself very lucky to be where I am. While I believe in hard work, I never underestimate the role that luck has played in my journey so far.
The National University of Ireland, Galway (now University of Galway) was my first choice of university.</description>

      <description>If I had to sum up my experience as the captain of my college football team into a single word, it&amp;rsquo;d be - Grateful
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy start for me. Most of it was because of the confidence (or lack thereof) in myself. I doubted my ability as a football player and as a leader. I was afraid of being a failure. It was a big responsibility and the last thing I would want to do is lose the respect of my players.</description>

      <title>Getting into Habits</title>

      <description>I started with the habit of reading. It was more of a new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution. It was difficult at first, trying to read everyday. My plan initially was to read atleast one chapter a day. I knew I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to maintain this habit, but I was really really determined to complete atleast one book a month. It&amp;rsquo;s May now, and I think my determination paid off. I&amp;rsquo;ve so far read The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry in January, Animal Farm by George Orwell in February, Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in March and Storm in a Teacup by Helen Czerski in April.</description>
