They argue that previous research was conducted in environments that didn't offer any incentive or need to adapt and hence, these agents were bounded by their intelligence.

Having a multi-agent (species) environment encourages agents to adapt which results in the development of intelligence.

Examples given are similar to the one's in the prisoner's dilemma (row vs column players).

At what level do we consider an adaptive unit (agent) to be a success? Each adaptive unit or agent has sub-units or agents interactive at the sub-level, so on and so forth.

The agent does not need to choose between exploitation vs exploration because it encounters new experiences via changing environment dynamics.

Exogenous autocurricula could end up in a loop where the challenges produced are repeated though the implementations may be different.

Self-play can help help break this loop but care must be taken that older policies are not forgotten while the agent plays against its newer versions. Playing against older policies will prevent the agent from making the same mistakes it made earlier.

**Read - Malthusian RL algorithm**

When an adaptive unit has sub-units that are not willing to co-operate, it could lead to the failure of the collective as a whole. At such a point, even the sacrifice of a single individual may not be enough. For this, any social dilemma will require a critical fraction of the population to change, for the entire collective to survive.

When you try to solve one social dilemma, another one will take its place. This creates a sequence of enodgenous challenges growing in scope and complexity (an autocurriculum).

Exogenous challenges on the collective can resolve the endogenous challenges by aligning the incentives of the sub-units. The collective becomes a single atomic individual.

Two possiblities on why humans evolved and apes didn't - 

* Cumulative culture (exogenous)
* Self domestication (endogenous)
