TL;DR - Try to make it as easy and fun as possible at the start. Once you get the hang of it, start challenging yourself. Exploring different domains is key and once you find your niche, delve in deeper.

## My First Introduction to AI

My first ever introduction to AI was through video games. The earliest game that I can remember playing was [Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2UZImFFmsoK5dD-uvU_hg). Since being a kid (and even now) I've always been fascinated with the use of AI in games. While I know that the use of AI in game development is different from fields like Data Science, Data Analytics etc. I cannot help but acknowledge the fact that without video games, I probably wouldn't even be interested in computers! So +1 to video games for without them, I probably wouldn't even be here.

## My First Proper Introduction to Machine Learning

It was during my Second Year of Engineering when we had something known as *Project-Based Learning*. To put it simply - We choose a domain we would like to study, build a project and submit that project for grading. Some of the popular topics back then were Mobile Development and Web Development. I was honestly not sure on what I should take but thanks to my father, he recommended selecting Machine Learning. Shortly after the domains were finalized, I worked on my very first Machine Learning project (you can find it [here](https://github.com/kad99kev/Cardio-ML)) which also happened to be my first ever Python project.

## What Came Next?

Summer vacations are more projects. These projects happened to be my first time working with JavaScript. It was around that time when I came across [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman). His book [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/) and his videos on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Genetic Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8gZguZWYik&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bw4n02JP28QDuUdNi3EXxJ), [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) and [Tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/) kept me busy throughout the summer. I don't think there was a point where I needed to find motivation. I was enjoying the processing of learning and building.

## Where I Went Wrong?

In my Third Year of Engineering, things were getting a bit intense. It was the classic example of *The more you know, the more you don't know* for me. I constantly spent my time developing projects and participating in hackathons **even though** I knew it didn't make me happy. As a result, I ended up neglecting my health, family and friends. It wasn't a particularly proud time in my life, but in my attempt to learn Machine Learning, I learnt a lot about life.

## What I Am Doing Now?

I now spend my time reading [Deep Learning from Scratch: Building with Python from First Principles](https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Learning-Scratch-Building-Principles/dp/935213902X) by Seth Weidman while also participating in a few Kaggle competitions every now and then. I plan to write a few technical articles soon along with a few side projects that I have in mind. My plan is to continue this exploration and to find new things to learn and apply. It is not possible to know everything in AI, so might as well take it at your own pace and enjoy while you learn :D
