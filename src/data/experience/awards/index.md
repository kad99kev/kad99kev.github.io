# Tata-Symbiosis Hackathon
## 4th Place
#### SEPTEMBER 2019

Our topic was: Intent Classification based on audio clips. We used Google's Speech-to-Text to convert the voice clips into text. We trained the OpenNMT model to translate Marathi into English to carry out our intent classification task. Though we did not win top 3, this was my first national hackathon and I am proud to say we finished 4th from more than 400 teams.

#### I've also participated in many other hackathons and coding competitions! But these are the ones I found success in :)

#### Hardwork never fails :D
